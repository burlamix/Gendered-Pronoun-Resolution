When he was chosen to replace Gaiman as the writer of the ongoing The Books of Magic series, John Ney Rieber discovered that a gaming guide to the DC universe had listed Titania as Hunter's mother: he also knew that a key part of the character's appeal, however, was that he was a normal teenaged boy.	he	580	Timothy Hunter	452	False	John Ney Rieber	668	True	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faerie_(DC_Comics)
